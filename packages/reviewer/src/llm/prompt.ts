## PR Information
Title: ${pr.title}
Author: ${pr.author.username}
Branch: ${pr.sourceBranch} → ${pr.targetBranch}

## Description
${pr.description || 'No description provided.'}

## Changed Files (${diff.files.length} files)
${fileList}

## Diff
${diffResult.content}
${graphSection}${skillContext}${examplesSection}${rejectedSection}
${truncationWarning}

## Review Instructions
1. Analyse the diff for issues: correctness, security, performance, maintainability
2. Reference exact file paths and line numbers from the diff
3. Focus on real issues, not nitpicks
4. For each issue provide: severity, concrete impacts, a code suggestion, reproduction steps

## Output Format

SUMMARY:
[2-3 sentence overall assessment]

Then for each issue, output a [File:, Line:] marker followed immediately by the comment body. Use the EXACT file path from the diff.

[File: /src/api/services/publish_workflow/model.py, Line: 103]
**Suggestion:** With the current union type ordering, responses that include a \`diff\` field will always be parsed as the variant without \`diff\`, causing the diff payload to be silently dropped in FastAPI's response validation.

<details>
<summary><b>Severity Level:</b> Major ⚠️</summary>

- ⚠️ \`/publish_workflow/generate_change_logs\` never returns diff payloads.
- ⚠️ Clients requesting \`include_diff=true\` cannot access deterministic diffs.
- ⚠️ Server-side diff computation is wasted; results discarded in serialization.

</details>

\`\`\`suggestion
    ChangelogGeneratedWithDiffResult,
    ChangelogGeneratedResult,
\`\`\`

<details>
<summary><b>Steps to Reproduce</b></summary>

1. Send a POST request to \`/publish_workflow/generate_change_logs\` with \`"include_diff": true\`.
2. Observe the response body — the \`diff\` field is absent despite being computed server-side.

[Confidence: 0.91]

[File: /next/file/path.py, Line: 55]
... next comment body ...
[Confidence: 0.75]

VERDICT: approve|request_changes|comment

## Confidence Scoring (REQUIRED)
For EACH comment, include a self-assessed confidence score at the end of the comment body.

Format: add [Confidence: X.X] at the end of the comment body, where X.X is a decimal from 0.0 to 1.0.

Scoring guide:
- 0.9-1.0: Definite bug, security issue, or clear correctness problem
- 0.7-0.9: Likely issue with clear impact
- 0.5-0.7: Potential issue, may be stylistic
- 0.0-0.5: Speculative — omit these entirely unless critical

Example:
[File: /src/auth.ts, Line: 42]
**Suggestion:** The token is not validated before use.
[Confidence: 0.92]

RULES:
- The [File:, Line:] marker must use the EXACT path from the diff (including any leading slash)
- Every added line in the diff is prefixed with \`[Line N]\` showing its exact file line number. Use ONLY those numbers in your [File:, Line:] markers.
- ONLY comment on \`[Line N] +\` lines (added lines). Lines starting with \`-\` are removals shown for context — do NOT place a comment on them.
- You may use <details>/<summary> for collapsible sections. Inside <details> blocks, use only plain text and bullet lists — never triple-backtick code fences inside <details> as they break rendering on Azure DevOps and other platforms.
- If the PR looks good output VERDICT: approve with no comments
- NEVER comment on whether a specific package/library version number is valid, exists, or is outdated. Your training data has a knowledge cutoff and package versions change constantly — you will be wrong. Skip ALL observations about version numbers, semver ranges, or whether a version is "the latest". Focus only on code logic, patterns, and correctness.
- NEVER mention "blast radius", "graph context", "codebase context", or any internal tooling concepts in your review comments. Use the codebase context section only to understand impact — your comments must read as if written by a human reviewer who knows the codebase.`;

Comment Count: ${review.comments.length}

## Task
Generate:
1) An improved PR title
2) A complete PR body in markdown with these sections:
   - ## What Changed
   - ## Why It Changed
   - ## Walkthrough
3) Change type category: bug|feature|refactor|docs|tests|chore
4) 2-6 labels (short slugs)

## Walkthrough Rules
- Use one bullet per materially changed file or module.
- Keep each bullet concise and specific.
- Mention concrete components/functions from the diff when available.

## Output Format (STRICT)
TITLE: <single line>
CHANGE_TYPE: bug|feature|refactor|docs|tests|chore
LABELS: label-one, label-two, label-three
BODY:
<full markdown body>

Rules:
- Do not include any extra sections outside the format above.
- The markdown body must be valid and reviewer-friendly.
- Avoid generic filler text.`;
