## PR Information
Title: ${pr.title}
Author: ${pr.author.username}
Branch: ${pr.sourceBranch} → ${pr.targetBranch}

## Description
${pr.description || 'No description provided.'}

## Changed Files (${diff.files.length} files)
${fileList}

## Diff
${diffResult.content}
${staticAnalysisSection}${skillContext}
${truncationWarning}

## Review Instructions
1. Analyse the diff for issues: correctness, security, performance, maintainability
2. Reference exact file paths and line numbers from the diff
3. Focus on real issues, not nitpicks
4. For each issue provide: severity, concrete impacts, a code suggestion, reproduction steps

## Output Format

SUMMARY:
[2-3 sentence overall assessment]

Then for each issue, output a [File:, Line:] marker followed immediately by the full markdown body of the comment, exactly like the example below. Use the EXACT file path from the diff.

[File: /src/api/services/publish_workflow/model.py, Line: 103]
**Suggestion:** With the current union type ordering, responses that include a \`diff\` field will always be parsed as the variant without \`diff\`, causing the diff payload to be silently dropped in FastAPI's response validation; reordering the union to try the diff-carrying variant first ensures clients receive the requested diff when \`include_diff\` is true. [logic-error]

<details>
<summary><b>Severity Level:</b> Major ⚠️</summary>

\`\`\`mdx
- ⚠️ \`/publish_workflow/generate_change_logs\` never returns diff payloads.
- ⚠️ Clients requesting \`include_diff=true\` cannot access deterministic diffs.
- ⚠️ Server-side diff computation is wasted; results discarded in serialization.

**Steps of Reproduction:**

<details>
<summary><b>Steps of Reproduction ✅</b></summary>

\`\`\`mdx
1. Start the FastAPI application and send a POST request to
   \`/publish_workflow/generate_change_logs\` with \`"include_diff": true\`
   and versions where \`generate_diff()\` reports changes.

2. Observe the response body contains only \`resultType\` and \`changelog\`
   — the \`diff\` field is absent despite being computed server-side.

will always be parsed as the variant without \`diff\`, causing the diff payload to be

Validate the correctness of the flagged issue. If correct, how can I resolve this?
If you propose a fix, implement it and please make it concise.

VERDICT: approve|request_changes|comment

## Confidence Scoring (REQUIRED)
For EACH comment, include a confidence score on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0 indicating how certain you are that this is a real, actionable issue.

Format: Add [Confidence: X.X] at the end of each comment body, before the VERDICT line.

Scoring guide:
- 0.9-1.0: Definite bug, security vulnerability, or clear correctness issue
- 0.7-0.9: Likely issue with clear impact, good confidence
- 0.5-0.7: Potential issue, may be style/preference
- 0.3-0.5: Speculative, may be false positive
- 0.0-0.3: Low confidence, likely noise

Example:
[File: /src/auth.ts, Line: 42]
**Suggestion:** ...comment body...
<details>...</details>
[Confidence: 0.85]

RULES:
- The [File:, Line:] marker must use the EXACT path from the diff (including any leading slash)
- The line number must appear in the diff
- Output the full markdown body for every comment — do not shorten or summarise the sections
- If the PR looks good output VERDICT: approve with no comments
- NEVER comment on whether a specific package/library version number is valid, exists, or is outdated. Your training data has a knowledge cutoff and package versions change constantly — you will be wrong. Skip ALL observations about version numbers, semver ranges, or whether a version is "the latest". Focus only on code logic, patterns, and correctness.`;
